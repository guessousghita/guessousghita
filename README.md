- It's me, @guessousghita - glad you found me :)
- I am a PhD student in biophysics, who is interested in understanding the simplest complex biological systems: bacteria!
- I am currently learning lots of things: some NLP, Mandarin, how to make the perfect bread, cool biotech applications and how to listen to my many (yes, MANY!) orchids ðŸŒ± .
- As you can tell, varied interets- I am a true and tested generalist!
- It's the internet, you'll find how to reach me!
